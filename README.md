# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, World!

Hi, I'm Chris - I work as a developer providing professional solutions and support to clients via Excel, PowerBI, and .NET Core.

I have a passion for learning and love to collaborate on content while doing my best to give back to the community that made it possible for me to learn and grow.

I'm currently exploring .NET Core Blazor and Frontend Web Development namely full stack JavaScript applications.

I enjoy reading articles/books covering modern technologies, gaming, writing, and bowling.
